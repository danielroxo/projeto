<h1>Designing a new feature</h1>
<div>
	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	<p>Our goal was to design a new feature on an already existing global app.</p>
	<p>It was intended for our feature to be intricate enough, while still sticking to the existing brand design system.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>The new Karaoke feature will allow users to read the lyrics and sing their favorite songs solo or in group, via desktop or mobile. We had one month to develop this project.</p>
